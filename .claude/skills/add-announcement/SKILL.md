# Add / edit / remove an announcement

Use this when the user asks to add, change, or remove a message in the
horizontal announcements banner shown just below the header on every page
of the site.

## File

`config/announcements.json` — a JSON array, empty (`[]`) by default. Each
entry:

```json
{ "text": "Fall Fest & Trunk or Treat is October 30 — get your tickets now!", "href": "https://example.com" }
```

or, to link to a page on this site instead of an external URL:

```json
{ "text": "New sponsorship levels are open!", "page_url": "become_sponsor" }
```

Use `page_url` (a key from `config/site.json`'s `page_urls`) for an internal
page, or `href` for an external link — never both on the same entry. `text`
is the whole clickable message; keep it short (one line, no line breaks) since
it has to fit the banner at every screen width. **Never use emoji in `text`**
— the PTA wants this professional, not casual; every text announcement
already gets a small built-in speaker icon automatically, so no icon of any
kind needs to be typed into the message itself.

For a real image icon instead of the built-in speaker icon, add
`icon_filename` — a small image file already in `assets/images/` (same place
hero/board photos live):

```json
{ "text": "New sponsorship levels are open!", "page_url": "become_sponsor", "icon_filename": "megaphone.png" }
```

If the PTA already has a **designed flyer graphic** for this announcement,
use `flyer_filename` instead — the whole banner becomes that flyer image
(no icon/text/arrow), clickable through to `href`/`page_url` same as any
other entry. The file goes in `assets/flyers/announcements/` (same pattern
as `assets/flyers/before-after-school/`, `assets/flyers/fundraising/`, etc.):

```json
{ "text": "Fall Fest flyer", "page_url": "events", "flyer_filename": "fall-fest-2026.jpg" }
```

`text` is still required even with `flyer_filename` — it becomes the
image's `alt` text for anyone who can't see it. Never combine
`icon_filename` and `flyer_filename` on the same entry (flyer wins, icon is
ignored) — pick one.

**Linking an announcement to a real calendar event** (e.g. "add an
announcement for Fall Fest"): check `config/events.json` for that event —
if it's there and already has an `attachments` entry (a flyer already on
the calendar), copy that flyer's `href` into the announcement as
`flyer_href` instead of `flyer_filename` — this reuses the event's existing
flyer via the same Drive-thumbnail mechanism the Events page itself uses,
so nothing needs to be re-uploaded:

```json
{ "text": "Fall Fest & Trunk or Treat — details and RSVP", "page_url": "events", "flyer_href": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SVx35OvI6TtwA_IhRHi4SW1lC35L8liL" }
```

If that event also has a `date` field, set `expires` to the day *after*
that date (see below) — computed once, now, not left for a future rebuild
to figure out.

**Expiration** — add `expires` (an ISO date, `"YYYY-MM-DD"`) to have an
announcement automatically stop showing after that date (dropped from the
banner on the next rebuild, so within about an hour via the hourly sync,
same as everything else calendar-driven on this site):

```json
{ "text": "Fall Fest & Trunk or Treat — details and RSVP", "page_url": "events", "expires": "2026-10-31" }
```

- **Linked to a calendar event**: set `expires` to one day after that
  event's own `date` in `config/events.json` (e.g. event date `2026-10-30`
  → `expires: "2026-10-31"`). Compute this once, now, when you add the
  entry — never leave it to be re-derived later, since `config/events.json`
  only ever holds a *rolling* window of upcoming events and the event
  itself will have scrolled out of that file by the time its own expiry
  date actually arrives.
- **Not calendar-linked** (a general message, an ongoing program): only
  add `expires` if the user gives you an actual end date. Otherwise leave
  it unset — the announcement stays up until someone removes it manually.
- Never guess a date — same rule as everywhere else on this site. If asked
  to link an announcement to an event you can't find in
  `config/events.json`, say so rather than inventing a date.

**Important behavior to know**: when this file is `[]`, the entire banner is
omitted from every page — not shown as an empty bar. Adding the first entry
makes it appear everywhere automatically; removing the last entry makes it
disappear everywhere automatically. This is by design — don't "fix" it by
editing templates.

**Rotation and dismissal**: with more than one entry, the banner
auto-rotates between them every few seconds with a smooth fade. A visitor
who dismisses the banner (the × button) won't see it again on that browser
*for the same set of announcements* — changing this file's content
(adding, removing, or editing any entry) automatically un-dismisses the
banner for everyone, since dismissal is remembered against a hash of the
current content, not "the banner" in general. You don't need to do
anything special to make an edit "count" as new — any change to this file
does.

## Steps

1. Read `config/announcements.json`.
2. **Adding**: append a new `{ }` entry. Ask for the exact message text and where it should link (an internal page, or an external URL) if not given. If the request references a specific calendar event, check `config/events.json` for it first — reuse its flyer (`flyer_href`, see above) and compute `expires` from its `date` field, rather than asking the user to supply either.
3. **Editing**: change the relevant field(s) in place.
4. **Removing**: delete the entry.
5. Run `python3 src/build.py`.
6. Run `python3 test/validate_build.py` — confirm it passes.
7. Report that every page changed (mention explicitly if the banner just appeared or disappeared for the first time, and that any edit re-shows the banner to visitors who'd previously dismissed the old version) and remind the user to push (`docs/SOP.md` Task 7) — GitHub Actions rebuilds and redeploys automatically.

## Do not

- Do not edit `src/templates/announcement-banner.html.tmpl`, the
  `build_announcement_banner` function in `src/build.py`, or the
  `.thes__announce*` CSS rules in `src/templates/tokens.html.tmpl`. If the
  request needs different rotation timing, a different color, per-page
  targeting, or anything else the config can't express, stop and tell the
  user that's a template change, not a config change, and ask before
  proceeding.
