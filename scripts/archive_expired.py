"""
Move expired announcements and featured event pages out of the live
config and into archive/, for future reference.

  config/announcements.json  -> archive/announcements.json
  config/event-pages.json    -> archive/event-pages.json
  assets/flyers/<file>       -> archive/flyers/<file>   (their flyers)

"Expired" means today (in the PTA's own timezone) is past the entry's
`expires` date — the last day it's shown, inclusive. For an event page
with no explicit `expires`, that's the day the event ends; see
event_page_expires() in src/build.py, which this reuses so the two can
never disagree about what counts as expired.

Run by both .github/workflows/deploy.yml (every push) and
sync-events.yml (hourly), right before the build. archive/ is never
copied into the deployed site, so an archived page stops being
published on that same run — src/build.py also clears pages/events/ on
every build so the old HTML can't linger. The build filters expired
entries on its own too; this script is what makes it permanent and
keeps the live config files short.

A flyer is only moved if nothing still live references it (an event
page and an announcement can share one). Idempotent: running it again
with nothing expired changes nothing.

Stdlib only.
